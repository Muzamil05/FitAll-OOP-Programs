# FitAll-OOP-Programs

## 📖 About
 These Projects are programs created in Java using Object Oriented Programming where we were tasked to use principles and techniques of OOP to create a console based program that allowed users to book certain fitness sessions. These Programs were apart of our Object Oriented Programming module at university and each were 25% of our module grade. Overall, I recieved 72.65% for FitAll 1 and 85.25% for FitAll 2.
